### Innovation Points

#### 1. Hybrid Project Initialization
- Downloads official Spec Kit releases via `uvx specify-cli.py init`
- Adds refactoring components to `.specify/` directory
- Maintains compatibility with standard Spec Kit workflow
- Provides both standard and refactoring commands in single project

#### 2. Behavior Preservation Constitution
- 20 detailed principles covering all aspects of refactoring
- Frontend-specific allowances for UI optimization
- Immutable constraints ensuring safety
- Comprehensive validation and rollback procedures

#### 3. Code Analysis Integration
- `/specify-refactoring` analyzes existing codebases instead of user descriptions
- Generates specifications based on actual code structure
- Identifies refactoring opportunities and constraints
- Creates comprehensive analysis reports

#### 4. Phased Task Generation
- 5-phase approach: Behavior Documentation → Interface Analysis → Implementation → Validation → Migration
- Each phase has specific deliverables and validation criteria
- Incremental implementation with continuous verification
- Complete rollback capability at each phase
