# Refactoring Implementation Plan: [SYSTEM]

**Branch**: `[###-refactoring-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Refactoring specification from `/specs/[###-refactoring-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan-refactoring command scope)
```
1. Load refactoring spec from Input path
   â†’ If not found: ERROR "No refactoring spec at {path}"
2. Perform comprehensive code analysis
   â†’ Analyze existing implementation for behavior mapping
   â†’ Identify all interfaces and dependencies
   â†’ Document current architecture and patterns
3. Fill Current System Analysis section
   â†’ Document existing behavior patterns
   â†’ Map all public interfaces and contracts
4. Execute Automated Constitution Compliance
   â†’ Run `specify refactoring reality-check` for mock data detection
   â†’ Validate behavior preservation requirements automatically
   â†’ Verify progressive refactoring prerequisites
5. Evaluate Automated Compliance results
   â†’ If validation fails: Immediate halt with specific error guidance
   â†’ If warnings exist: Document mitigation strategies
   â†’ Update Progress Tracking: Automated Validation Check
6. Execute Phase 0 â†’ research.md
   â†’ Analyze current implementation and refactoring options
   â†’ If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
7. Execute Phase 1 â†’ contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
   â†’ Focus on interface preservation and behavior mapping
8. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   â†’ If new violations: Refactor approach, return to Phase 1
   â†’ Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
9. Plan Phase 2 â†’ Describe refactoring task generation approach
10. STOP - Ready for /tasks-refactoring command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan-refactoring command STOPS at step 9. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks-refactoring command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Refactoring Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Core Principles Verification
**Behavior Preservation (I)**: All refactoring MUST preserve 100% functional behavior - no exceptions  
**Interface Stability (II)**: Public interfaces MUST remain unchanged - signatures, parameters, contracts  
**Data Contract Integrity (III)**: Database structures and serialization formats MUST be preserved  
**Concurrency Consistency (IV)**: No new concurrency units - retry, timeout, backoff strategies unchanged  
**Structural Changes Only (V)**: Only file/module movement, splitting, type annotations, documentation permitted  

### **IMPORTANT: Frontend UI/UX Modernization Principle**
**Functional Logic vs UI/UX Distinction**:
- **âœ… PRESERVE 100%**: Business logic, data flow, user workflows, functional behavior
- **ðŸš€ ENCOURAGED TO OPTIMIZE**: UI layout, styling, interactions, UX patterns, responsiveness
- **ðŸŽ¯ GOAL**: Leverage new technology stack to improve user experience while maintaining functional integrity  

### Prohibited Changes Verification
**Prohibited Changes (VI)**: Backend performance optimizations, algorithm replacements, default values, log messages, sorting logic, randomness, I/O changes strictly forbidden

**Frontend-Specific Verification (VI-A/B)**:
- [ ] Frontend: **Functional behavior preserved** (business logic, data flow, user workflows)
- [ ] Frontend: **UI/UX modernization encouraged** (layout, styling, interactions based on new tech stack)
- [ ] Frontend: **Technology stack optimization** (utilize new framework capabilities for better UX)
- [ ] Frontend: **User experience enhancement** (improve interactions, responsiveness, accessibility)  

### Methodology Compliance
**Complete Migration (VII)**: Include all dependencies when extracting units - no coupling remnants  
**Immediate Updates (VIII)**: Batch-update all references after each migration unit  
**Single Responsibility (IX)**: Each commit addresses only one structural modification type  
**Incremental Revertibility (X)**: Every change must be independently verifiable and revertible  

### Automated Constitution Compliance
**Automated Enforcement**: All compliance checks are executed via `specify refactoring validate` command

**Reality Validation (Mandatory)**:
```bash
# Executed automatically before Phase 0
specify refactoring reality-check --component [COMPONENT] --fail-on-mock
```
- **Mock Data Detection**: Automatic scanning prevents mock/fake data usage
- **Business Logic Completeness**: Verifies no TODO/FIXME placeholders remain
- **Integration Authenticity**: Ensures real API calls and data sources
- **Validation Score**: Must achieve â‰¥80% integration authenticity

**Behavior Preservation Verification (Mandatory)**:
```bash
# Executed automatically during Phase 1-2
specify refactoring behavior-preserve --baseline [ORIGINAL] --refactored [NEW]
```
- **Interface Stability**: Automated diff analysis of public interfaces
- **Functional Equivalence**: Comparative testing of original vs refactored
- **Data Contract Integrity**: Schema validation and serialization testing
- **Concurrency Consistency**: Timing and ordering behavior verification
- **Frontend Functional Logic**: Business logic and user workflows preserved (UI/UX can be optimized)

**Progressive Refactoring Enforcement (Mandatory)**:
```bash
# Strict phase sequence enforcement
specify refactoring baseline --component [COMPONENT]           # Phase 0: Prerequisite
specify refactoring api-contract --component [COMPONENT]       # Phase 0: API Contract Extraction  
specify refactoring component-replace --component [COMPONENT]  # Phase 2: Sequential
specify refactoring parallel-validation --component [COMPONENT] # Phase 3: Validation
```
- **Phase Gates**: Each phase automatically validates completion of previous phases
- **Rollback Capability**: Every operation creates restore points
- **Atomic Operations**: Each step is independently verifiable and revertible

**Automated Compliance Status**:
- âœ… **Reality Check**: [PASS/FAIL] - Mock data detection, business logic completeness
- âœ… **Behavior Preservation**: [PASS/FAIL] - Interface stability, functional equivalence  
- âœ… **Progressive Refactoring**: [PASS/FAIL] - Phase sequence, rollback capability
- âœ… **Data Integrity**: [PASS/FAIL] - Schema preservation, serialization consistency
- âœ… **Methodology Compliance**: [PASS/FAIL] - Single responsibility, atomic changes

**Validation Failure Actions**:
- **Reality Check Fail**: Immediate halt - Fix mock data/placeholders before continuing
- **Behavior Preservation Fail**: Design review required - Revisit Phase 1 approach
- **Phase Sequence Violation**: Automatic rollback - Follow prescribed order
- **Data Integrity Fail**: Schema migration review - Ensure 100% direct replacement

â””â”€â”€ tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/tasks-refactoring command)
```

### Source Code (preserving existing structure)
```
# Existing structure maintained
# Refactoring creates new files/components alongside existing ones
# Migration strategy determines replacement timing

# Example: Component refactoring
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ legacy-component.js       # Original component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ refactored-component.js   # New implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ legacy-service.js         # Original service
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ refactored-service.js     # New implementation
â””â”€â”€ api-contracts/                # Extracted API contracts
```

**Structure Decision**: [PRESERVE existing structure, ADD new components alongside old ones]

## Phase 0: Code Analysis & Research
1. **Execute Reality Validation**:
   ```bash
   # Automated validation before any analysis
   specify refactoring reality-check --component [COMPONENT] --fail-on-mock
   ```
   - **Mock Data Detection**: Automatic scanning and prevention
   - **Business Logic Completeness**: Verify no placeholders exist
   - **Integration Authenticity**: Ensure real data sources and APIs
   - **Validation Output**: Report with specific violation locations and fixes

2. **Analyze current implementation**:
   - Map all business logic and data flows
   - Identify performance bottlenecks and technical debt
   - Document all dependencies and integration points

3. **Research refactoring approaches**:
   ```bash
   For each component to refactor:
     Task: "Analyze {component} behavior and interfaces"
   For each technical challenge:
     Task: "Research best practices for {challenge} refactoring"
   ```

4. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Current implementation analysis
   - Refactoring approach selection
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Migration timeline and milestones
   - **Validation Report**: Include automated reality check results

**Output**: research.md with complete behavior mapping, refactoring strategy, and validation compliance report

**Prerequisite**: Reality Validation must PASS (â‰¥80% integration authenticity, zero mock data violations)

## Phase 1: Refactoring Design
*Prerequisites: research.md complete + Reality Validation PASS*

1. **Execute Behavior Preservation Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Automated verification during design phase
   specify refactoring behavior-preserve --baseline [ORIGINAL] --refactored [NEW]
   ```
   - **Interface Stability**: Automated diff analysis of public APIs
   - **Functional Equivalence**: Comparative testing requirements
   - **Data Contract Integrity**: Schema validation specifications
   - **Validation Output**: Compatibility report with specific preservation requirements

2. **Create core refactoring documentation trio**:
   
   **A. Extract data models** â†’ `data-models.md`:
   - Extract all TypeScript interfaces and data models from source code
   - Document data relationships and type constraints
   - Define data integrity preservation requirements
   - **Automated extraction**: `python3 scripts/extract-api-contracts.py --source [SOURCE] --output data-models.md`

   **B. Document application flows** â†’ `app-flows.md`:
   - Map all UX interaction logic and user workflows
   - Document business logic flows and state management
   - Define user requirement mappings from FRD
   - **Include user acceptance criteria** for each flow

   **C. Extract API contracts** â†’ `apis.md`:
   - Extract all HTTP endpoints and API contracts from source code
   - Document request/response formats and error handling
   - Define API compatibility requirements for direct replacement
   - **Automated extraction**: `python3 scripts/extract-api-contracts.py --source [SOURCE] --output apis.md`

3. **Create refactoring test strategy** â†’ `quickstart.md`:
   - Define comprehensive behavior preservation tests
   - Create baseline tests for current implementation
   - Define validation criteria for refactored implementation
   - **Include automated validation commands** in test strategy
   - **Include automated validation commands** in test strategy

5. **Execute Progressive Refactoring Baseline**:
   ```bash
   # Establish baseline for progressive refactoring
   specify refactoring baseline --component [COMPONENT]
   ```
   - **Component State Capture**: Current implementation state documentation
   - **Reference Point Creation**: Baseline for comparison during refactoring
   - **Rollback Point Establishment**: Restore point for safety

6. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `{SCRIPT}` for your AI assistant
   - Add refactoring-specific guidance and tools
   - Preserve existing configuration
   - Add behavior preservation requirements
   - **Include automated validation command references**

**Output**: Interface contracts, data model preservation docs, test strategy, agent updates, baseline validation report

**Validation Gate**: Behavior Preservation Verification must PASS (100% interface stability, functional equivalence requirements defined)

## Phase 2: Refactoring Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks-refactoring command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan-refactoring*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-refactoring-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks focusing on behavior preservation:
  - Each interface â†’ API contract validation task [P0]
  - Each component â†’ refactoring task with validation [P]
  - Each business flow â†’ end-to-end testing task
  - Each risk â†’ mitigation task
- Prioritize tasks based on risk and dependency order

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Behavior documentation before any changes
- API contract validation before component refactoring
- Testing throughout implementation
- Risk mitigation tasks before high-risk changes
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent components)

**Estimated Output**: 30-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md with heavy emphasis on testing

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks-refactoring command, NOT by /plan-refactoring

## Phase 3+: Refactoring Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan-refactoring command*

**Phase 3**: Refactoring task execution (/tasks-refactoring command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation with behavior validation (execute tasks.md following refactoring principles)  
**Phase 5**: Comprehensive testing and deployment (validation and rollout)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., Parallel components] | [need for zero downtime] | [big-bang approach too risky] |
| [e.g., Complex data models] | [API contract requirement] | [must extract from source code] |
