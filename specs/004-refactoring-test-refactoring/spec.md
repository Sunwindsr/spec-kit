**Feature Branch**: `[###-refactoring-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Target System**: [DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM TO BE REFACTORED]

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Analyze existing codebase from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No target system description provided"
2. Extract current behavior and interfaces
   ‚Üí Identify: existing APIs, data models, UI components, business logic
3. Document refactoring objectives and constraints
   ‚Üí Preserve 100% behavior, maintain interface stability
4. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
5. Fill Current Behavior Analysis section
   ‚Üí If no clear behavior mapping: ERROR "Cannot determine current behavior"
6. Generate Refactoring Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must ensure behavior preservation
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
7. Identify Interface Stability Requirements
8. Run Refactoring Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If behavior changes found: ERROR "Remove behavior modifications"
9. Return: SUCCESS (refactoring spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Refactoring Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT needs refactoring and WHY
- ‚úÖ Preserve 100% existing behavior (behavior preservation)
- ‚úÖ Maintain interface stability (APIs, UI, data models)
- ‚ùå No new features or behavior changes
- üë• Written for system architects and developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every refactoring
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the refactoring
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For Refactoring Generation
When creating this spec from code analysis:
1. **Document current behavior**: Thoroughly analyze existing implementation
2. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any unclear aspects
3. **Preserve interfaces**: Identify all stable interfaces that must remain unchanged
4. **Plan migration**: Include incremental migration strategy
5. **Common refactoring areas**:
   - Architecture modernization
   - Performance optimization
   - Code quality improvements
   - Technology stack updates
   - Maintenance and extensibility enhancements

## Refactoring Objectives *(mandatory)*

### Business Requirements (EARS Format)
**EARS Requirements** - These describe WHAT the refactoring must achieve from a business perspective:

- **REQ-001**: When [user action or event], the system shall [maintain existing response] to preserve [business value]
- **REQ-002**: In the context of [specific scenario], when [condition occurs], the system shall [preserve existing behavior] to ensure [business outcome]
- **REQ-003**: When [integration point] is accessed, the system shall [maintain current interface] to support [business process]
- **REQ-004**: The system shall always [preserve critical business function] during and after refactoring

**Technical Refactoring Requirements**:
- **RF-001**: System MUST maintain 100% existing behavior
- **RF-002**: All public interfaces MUST remain stable and backward compatible
- **RF-003**: System MUST improve [specific aspect, e.g., "maintainability"]
- **RF-004**: System MUST preserve [specific aspect, e.g., "data integrity"]
- **RF-005**: System MUST enable [future capability, e.g., "easier testing"]

### Success Criteria
- **SC-001**: Zero behavioral changes detected through comprehensive testing
- **SC-002**: All existing integrations continue to function without modification
